PIP and Environments course.

This project contains two Casino games. The first one is Blackjack, it is developed for one player.
The second is classic Roulette. 
This repository also contains requirements with dependences and a Dockerfile, but these scripts are very simple and Dockerfile is not necessary. I put them only for learning purposes. 


```sh
git clone
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Blackjack

```sh
cd BlackJack
python3 main.py
```

# Roulette

```sh
cd Roulette
python3 main.py
```
